# Key Strokes
This is a python project that will help you type out anything. The idea is that if you have a peice of text that you can't copy + past. You can just paste it in the keystrokes.txt and run the `main.py` file.

Consider looking at the `main.py` file. At the end of the file is everything you will need.

> Also run the `run.py` or `pip install pyautogui`
